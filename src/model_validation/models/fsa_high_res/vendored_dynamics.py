Differences from upstream
-------------------------
The upstream `drift_jax` reads T_B(t) and Phi(t) from per-bin arrays
(96 bins/day) via integer-index lookup. For the OT-Control engine the
controls are scalar daily values supplied by the policy
(`PiecewiseConstant.evaluate(t, theta)`), so this vendored copy takes
`u = (T_B, Phi)` directly and skips the bin-lookup machinery. The high-
resolution aspect of the upstream simulator is for the observation
channel (15-min HR / sleep / stress / steps), not the control. The
control schedule is naturally daily.

Time is in days throughout (engine convention). The upstream simulator
also uses days, so no unit conversion is needed.

State convention: x = (B, F, A) where
    B in [0, 1]   fitness                (Jacobi diffusion)
    F >= 0        strain                 (CIR diffusion)
    A >= 0        endocrine amplitude    (regularised Landau)

Control convention: u = (T_B, Phi) where
    T_B in [0, 1] training-load target
    Phi >= 0      training intensity / strain production

    """Per-component diffusion sigma_i(x) for diagonal noise.

    Adapted from upstream `noise_scale_fn_jax` (simulation.py lines
    218-226). The upstream form is forward-only:

        sigma_B = sigma_B * sqrt(B*(1-B))     with B clipped to [eps, 1-eps]
        sigma_F = sigma_F * sqrt(F)           with F clipped to >= 0
        sigma_A = sigma_A * sqrt(A + eps_A)   no clip needed

    The clip-then-sqrt form has a +inf gradient at the boundary
    (d/dB[sqrt(B)] = 1/(2*sqrt(B))), which crashes JAX-AD when the
    state hits the boundary at any point during the trajectory. The
    OT-Control engine traces gradients through `simulate_latent`, so
    we need a smooth boundary regularisation. Hence:

        sigma_B = sigma_B * sqrt(B*(1-B) + eps_B)
        sigma_F = sigma_F * sqrt(F + eps_F)
        sigma_A = sigma_A * sqrt(A + eps_A)        (matches upstream)

    The eps regularisation keeps the argument of sqrt strictly positive,
    so the gradient is bounded. All three eps are 1e-4 (the same constant
    upstream uses for A) — small enough to be physiologically negligible
    and large enough to keep gradients finite.

    State-dependent forms:
      B: Jacobi sqrt(B*(1-B) + eps_B)
      F: CIR    sqrt(F + eps_F)
      A: Landau sqrt(A + eps_A)

    Defensive clipping
    ------------------
    `state_clip_fn` keeps the simulator's state inside physical bounds
    after each step, so under normal operation B is in [0, 1] when
    `fsa_diffusion` is called. This function additionally clips B to
    [0, 1] internally as a defence-in-depth measure: an out-of-bounds
    B (e.g. from a caller that bypasses the simulator) would otherwise
    drive `B*(1-B) + EPS_B` negative and produce NaN. The clip's
    sub-gradient is zero outside [0, 1], so AD remains well-defined.
